Note that currently, styles from the Visuals design spec are sourced from the
the YAML files in this folder, which were copied from [Colour guide 2025](https://www.figma.com/design/lQ8KHxsb8xIJaMujuJV9dr/Colour-guide-2025?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=0ThLMx10HCgM8IMZ-0) and [Style guide colour original](https://www.figma.com/design/RZHnmwc2tmB6j1k4bNtyND/Style-guide-colour-original?node-id=1124-325&t=R623TB74lQ0mzI9X-0) by hand.

In time these styles should come directly from Figma via its API, but for that to work, we need
the styles arranged and published in a Figma library.
