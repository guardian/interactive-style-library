Note that currently, styles from the Visuals design spec are sourced from the
[`./figma-color-spec.yaml`], which was copied from the [Colour guide 2025 Figma document](https://www.figma.com/design/lQ8KHxsb8xIJaMujuJV9dr/Colour-guide-2025?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=0ThLMx10HCgM8IMZ-0) by hand.

In time these styles should come directly from Figma via its API, but for that to work, we need
the styles arranged and published in a Figma library.
